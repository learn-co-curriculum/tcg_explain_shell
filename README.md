# Explain Shell

## Learning Goals

- Use tool to visualize parts of shell commands

## Introduction

Shell commands are notoriously terse and hard to parse. What in the heck does a command like the following mean?

```sh
ls -a | tee | wc -l
```

Someone built a helpful tool for breaking the pieces of shell out individually and explaining them one by one.

1. Visit [Explain Shell](https://explainshell.com/)
2. Copy and paste the above command into the box
3. Read the explanations for each of the pieces of the command
4. When you think you have an understanding of what the command does, run it in your terminal. Do you see the output that you expected to see?

Click through the other examples to get a sense for the other explanations the tool can offer. As you practice other shell commands, refer back to [Explain Shell](https://explainshell.com/) to learn uses of different tools and the meanings of different options and flags available.
